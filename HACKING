This document contains some information that is useful when working with the
source code.

Mercurial on Windows
====================

Windows users should use the EOL extension as described here:
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/EolExtension>.

Coding Guidelines
=================

We try to follow the
[Style Guide for Python Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Other
guidelines and exceptions to the standard are listed here.

Strings
-------

We use the " character for strings. Not the ' character.

Naming convention for private attributes
----------------------------------------

All methods inside a class that are not supposed to be called outside the class
should be marked private by prefixing it with one underscore.

All member variables should always be considered private but we don't append
any underscores. The preferred way to access a class' variable is to write a
get-method. In general member variables should never be directly accessed
outside a class.
