The file boot_common.py should reside in the python directory 
under Lib/site_packages/py2exe.

The Timeline version of boot_common.py changes the log directory 
to a temp dir on the system that is always writeable.

So even if the program is installed in the "Program files" 
directory, the log file can be written without any access problems.
