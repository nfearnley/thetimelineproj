    The Secretariat uses Timeline to organise its important documents visually,
    so that users can easily locate and open minutes, MOUâ€™s, letters etc. This
    allows us to send out Timeline to multiple stakeholders who can access but
    not alter the database, and saves us time in responding to requests for
    information. It is an easy to use and robust piece of software. Highly
    recommended.
