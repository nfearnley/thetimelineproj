Release instructions
====================

Feature freeze
--------------

When all features for a major version (x.y) have been implemented in main we
move the development for that version over to stable. In stable we prepare for
the (x.y.0) release and then continue to do bugfix releases (x.y.1, x.y.2, ..)
there.

Features for the next version (x.y+1) can continue to be developed in main.

1. Move main repo to stable repo
    1. ``cd stable``
    2. ``hg pull ../main``
    3. ``hg push``
2. Change versions numbers in main to denote the next version (x.y+1.0)
    1. timelinelib/meta/version.py
    2. doc/changelog.rst
    3. Run ``python test/execute-specs.py`` to find where else you need to modify
3. Commit and push
