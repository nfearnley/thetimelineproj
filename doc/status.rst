Project status
==============

Timeline is actively being developed.

Roughly every third month there is a new release of Timeline.  The
:doc:`changelog` shows when the latest version was released as well as when we
plan the next release.

The :doc:`process` says something about how we work and what functionality goes
into Timeline.

We are looking for more developers
----------------------------------

We want to get more people involved in the development of Timeline.

If you are interested, please get in touch with us. We will help you to get
started developing timeline and answer any questions you have.
