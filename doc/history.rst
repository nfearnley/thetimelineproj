Initial mission statement
-------------------------

In the very beginning, timeline was created because Rickard was frustrated with
regular calendars. He found it difficult to get a sense of when events occurred
in time. Especially events far apart that would not fit in a calendar view. He
thought that presenting events on a timeline where he could quickly zoom in and
out and move around to show different views would help.

So, the core task of timeline is to **display and navigate events on a
timeline**. It has done that since version 0.1.0 which was released on 11 April
2009. Excerpt from the README:

    The Timeline Project aims to create a cross-platform application for
    displaying and navigating information on a timeline. The main goal is that
    it should be easy to quickly display different periods in time with
    different kinds of information on the timeline.

If you have data that you would like to display on a timeline, timeline should
be able to show it. Timeline has multiple backends to display data from
different sources.

2015 conference
---------------

One of the decisions on the conference was to let the timeline community decide
the direction in which timeline should develop.
