Testing
-------

The **easiest** way to help improve Timeline is to use it and send **feedback**
to the user mailing list: thetimelineproj-user@lists.sourceforge.net.

Translating
-----------

Timeline is translated on **Launchpad**:
http://translations.launchpad.net/thetimelineproj.

For instructions how to **get started** translating on Launchpad, check out
this page: http://help.launchpad.net/Translations/StartingToTranslate.

Packaging
---------

If there is no binary package for Timeline on your platform you can help create
one. Send an email to the user mailing list if you are interested:
thetimelineproj-user@lists.sourceforge.net.

Hacking
-------

We use `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com>`_ as our version control
system. All our repositories can be `browsed online
<http://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/_list/hg>`_.

The command below will get you the latest version of the source code::

    hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/thetimelineproj/main

The `Status page <http://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/wiki/Status/>`_
contains some information about what we are working on right now and what we
are planning for the future.
