Person interested in developing timeline::

    We're glad you're interested in contributing to Timeline. We want to help
    as much as we can.

    Here are some points you can start with:

    * We have a backlog of problems that we want to solve
      (https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog)

    * Crash reports in the backlog are usually easy to fix. Although they might
      require some investigation.

    * Timeline is licensed under GLPv3. We propose a model where you (and
      everyone else) keep the copyright of their patches. As the patches will
      be GPLv3 as well, we can include them in the project.

    * Registering on this mailing list is a good idea.

    * The website has some more information:
      http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/

    * Some sections about developing are outdated.

    * We're here on the mailing list to help you with any questions you have :-)
