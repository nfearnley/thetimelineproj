Mission statement
=================

This page describes problems that timeline tries to solve and also problems
that it does not intend to solve. It should not be read as a feature list, but
more like a vision. If it says that timeline should be able to do something, it
doesn't mean that it can do it today, but that it is a problem that timeline
might solve in the future.

Editing events
--------------

If timeline only displayed events, it would be cumbersome to edit them. You
would have to edit them in one program, then open timeline to view them.
Therefore, timeline can also edit the events that it displays.

However, read-only timelines have always existed, indicating that the very core
task is displaying events on a timeline, and not editing events. But being able
to edit events from within timeline makes it usable in more situations.

Problems that timeline does not solve
