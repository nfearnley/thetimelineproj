             This new feature enables you to scroll the Timeline events vertically.
             You accomplish this by pressing the Ctrl+Shift keys and then scroll the mouse wheel.
             Point events and period events are scrolled in opposite directions and disappear
             from view when they cross the divider line.

             Containers are a way to group events together.
             In a container events can not overlap, so if you add a new event to a container
             all other events are moved to give room for the new event. The same thing happens
             if you resize an event within the container.
