    Read (and write) timeline data from persistent storage.

    All methods that modify timeline data should automatically write it to
    persistent storage.

    A TimelineIOError should be raised if reading or writing fails. After such
    a failure the database it not guarantied to return correct data. (Read and
    write errors are however very rare.)

    A timeline database is observable so that GUI components can update
    themselves when data changes. The two types of state changes are given as
    constants above.

    Future considerations: If databases get large it might be inefficient to
    save to persistent storage every time we modify the database. A solution is
    to add an explicit save method and have all the other methods just modify
    the database in memory.
