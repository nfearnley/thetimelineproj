The recommended way to install Timeline is with a binary package or installer.
If that is not available for your platform, instructions for installing from
source follows below.

Prerequisites
=============

Required:

  * Python version 2.4 or 2.5
      http://www.python.org
  * wxPython version 2.8.8 or greater
      http://www.wxpython.org
  * Markdown version 1.7 or greater
      http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/
  * iCalendar version 1.2 or greater
      http://codespeak.net/icalendar/

For translations (other than English) you also need the following:

  * SCons
      http://www.scons.org/
  * gettext version 0.17
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

Installing prerequisites on a Debian-based system
-------------------------------------------------

Note: If your version of wxPython is less than 2.8.8 you need to install a
newer version. Check out this wiki page for instructions how to do that:
http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian.

  apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 wx2.8-i18n python-markdown
  apt-get install scons gettext

You have to install iCalendar manually since there is no Debian package for it.
See section on installing iCalendar below.

Installing gettext on Windows
-----------------------------

Get the zipfiles gettext-tools-0.17.zip and gettext-runtime-0.17-1.zip from
here http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/.

Installing iCalendar
--------------------

The easiest way to install iCalendar is to download the source code from its
website and then copy the iCalendar-1.2/src/icalendar folder to the root folder
of Timeline.

The important thing is that you can do 'import icalendar' from Python.

Platforms
=========

Timeline has been tested with the following platforms and versions of Python
and wxPython:

Platform              Python   wxPython

If you are experiencing problems with a different platform, please send an
email to the user mailing list thetimelineproj-user@lists.sourceforge.

Install and Start Timeline
==========================

To install the translations, run this command:

  cd <path-to-timeline-directory>
  scons mo

To run the application, use this command:

  python <path-to-timeline-directory>/timeline.py [options]

For example:

  python /home/rick/timeline-0.8.0/timeline.py

Preferable you create a shortcut on your platform that issues this command.

What options are available is displayed with the following command:

  python <path-to-timeline-directory>/timeline.py --help
