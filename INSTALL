This document describes how to install the software as well as how to upgrade
from a previous version. 

Prerequisites
=============

Timeline is written in the Python programming language and uses the wxPython
library for the GUI. Both these components are needed in order to run
Timeline. For further instructions on how to download and install these, go to
their respective home pages:

 * Python (http://www.python.org)
 * wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org)

Platforms
=========

Timeline has been tested with the following platforms and versions of Python an
wxPython:

Platform              Python   wxPython
---------------------------------------
Windows (XP)          2.5.2    2.8.8.1
Linux (Debian Etch)   2.4.6    2.8.10.1
Linux (Debian Etch)   2.5.2    2.8.10.1

Install and Start Timeline
==========================

To begin with, extract the downloaded zip-file into a directory of your choice.

To run the application, use this command:

  python <path-to-timeline-directory>/main.py [options]

Preferable you create a shortcut on your platform that issues this command.

What options are available is displayed with the following command:

  python <path-to-timeline-directory>/main.py --help

Notes on Upgrading
==================

0.1.x to 0.2.x
--------------

The file format for version 0.2.x is not backwards compatible with version
0.1.x. 0.2.x can read 0.1.x files though so there is no need to be concerned
when upgrading.
