This folder contains two things:

  * Unit tests that can be run with 'python run.py'
  * Timeline files filled with data suitable for testing something

We don't believe that unit test are that necessary. We prefer to ensure good
code quality with code reviews. However, some parts of the source code is well
suited for unit testing, and in those cases we use it.
