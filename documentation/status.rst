Project status
==============

Timeline is being actively developed.

Roughly every third month there is a new release of Timeline. The
:doc:`changelog` shows when the latest version was released as well as when we
plan the next release.

Since Timeline is an open source project, anyone can participate in the
development and make contributions to each release. Have a look at
:doc:`contributing` for more information.

News about the project can be found on the :sf:`SourceForge news page <news>`.
