This document describes the project status: what is happening right now and
what might happen in the future.

A note about version numbers
============================

Timeline uses a three-component version numbering system (X.Y.Z).

Z is only incremented when bugs are corrected or translations are updated. The
functionality of the program is the same for all X.Y versions.

Y is incremented every time a new feature is added.

X is incremented when the new version is no longer compatible with previous
versions or when the program undergoes some big change or significant
milestone.

Release cycle
=============

Roughly every third month there is a new feature release of Timeline. That
means that Y will increase by one. At the moment X is 0. That does not mean
that Timeline is unstable, but rather that we develop it incrementally in small
steps, releasing new versions often.

If critical bugs are found in a X.Y release, we try to fix them as fast as
possible and make the fix available in a bugfix release (X.Y is the same but Z
is incremented by one).

Future plans
============

In our issue tracker
(http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/thetimelineproj/report/3) we keep a list of
things we might want to implement in the future.
