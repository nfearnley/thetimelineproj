      <description>Timeline 0.3.0, released on 1 August 2009 ========================================= In this release the documentation has been improved and a few bugs have been fixed. The file format has also been updated to decrease the risk of loosing data. Users are therefore strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version. The file format is readable by the 0.2.0 version but it can not take advantage of the new format. New features, enhancements: * Changed to allow events without categories. * Improved what's displayed in the title bar (open file name first). * Added application icon. * Added Help menu. * Converted user manual to DocBook format. * Integrated user manual with application (first step). * Started experimenting with unit tests. * Added copyright notes to all source files. * Added AUTHORS, CHANGES, COPYING, and INSTALL. Bug fixes: * Fixed bug where application raised exceptions when scrolling to the very end or the very beginning of time (year 10 or year 9999). * If multiple timelines were opened, the displayed period would just be saved for the last opened one. That is fixed now so it is saved for all.</description>

      <description>Timeline 1.0.0, released on 30 September 2013 ============================================= New features, enhancements: * Get rid of printing. Printing does not work very well. A better way to print is to generate an image and then print the image from another program. * Get rid of old file formats. It was a long time since the old file format was used. It would be nice to get rid of that code. * Get rid of extended date ranges / Think of a better solution. Extended date ranges does not work very well and it added lots of complexity to the code. It would be nice to get rid of it all together. Perhaps we can come up with a better way to handle extended dates? * Adjustments made to be able to use wxpython version 2.9 Bug fixes:</description>

      <description>Version 1.7.0
-------------

This is a periodic release of Timeline. It contains many solutions to problems
identified by users of Timeline.

Data:

* Events can have multiple hyperlinks.
  (`#30 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/30/&gt;`_)

* An experimental feature allows entering dates before 4714 BC. This allows
  larger time periods to be created.
  (`#51 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/51/&gt;`_)

Drawing:

* An icon is drawn in the event box if it has hyperlinks. This makes it easier
  to see which events have hyperlinks.
  (`#29 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/29/&gt;`_)

* Period events can be configured to never be drawn above the center line. This
  should make it more obvious which events are period events and which are
  point events.
  (`#42 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/42/&gt;`_, `#46 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/46/&gt;`_)

* A setting exist that decides if event texts should be centered or not.
  (`#73 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/73&gt;`_)

* There is no horizontal padding between events. This allows more events to fit
  on the screen.
  (`#2 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/2&gt;`_)

* Some fonts used to draw the timeline can be customized. This should allow
  users to customize the look of their timelines to their taste.
  (`#63 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/63&gt;`_)

* A setting can draw point events with the left box edge at the vertical line.
  This makes it more clear where the event starts in time.
  (`#60 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/60/&gt;`_)

GUI:

* A notification is shown when a shortcut is saved.
  (`#23 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/23/&gt;`_)

* The category editor can be opened with double click. This makes the intuitive
  way to open the editor possible.
  (`#47 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/47/&gt;`_)

* The period checkbox in the event editor remembers its value from last time.
  This should speed up entering of period events.
  (`#28 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/28&gt;`_)

* Multiple events can be added to a category by selecting them and selecting a
  context menu item. This should make it more convenient to assign categories.
  (`#67 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/67&gt;`_)

* The tab-order of controls in the event editor dialog can be customized. This
  allows users to put their most frequently used controls first.
  (`#62 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/62&gt;`_)

* The divider line can be adjusted with mouse dragging. This should make it
  more convenient to use Timeline on a touch device.
  (`#58 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/58&gt;`_)

* Events can be moved vertically by selecting them and pressing Up/Down or
  selecting menu items. This makes it more obvious how to move events
  vertically.
  (`#45 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/45/&gt;`_)

Exporting:

* Exporting a whole timeline to several images now preserves the vertical position
  of events between images. So now images can be put together and the events
  will align correctly.
  (`#72 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/72/&gt;`_)

Misc:

* Undo works after compress. This allows users to undo compress action if
  the result was not desirable.
  (`#65 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/65/&gt;`_)

* Does not fail to open Timeline files that have period wider than 1200 years.
  This should prevent users from having to manually edit the xml file.
  (`#8 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/8/&gt;`_)

* Crash reports have information about locale settings. This makes it easier to
  troubleshoot errors depending on locale settings.
  (`#54 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/54/&gt;`_)

Fixed crash reports:

* ``AttributeError: 'EraEditorDialog' object has no attribute 'on_return'``
  (`#57 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/57/&gt;`_)

* ``KeyError: '33'``
  (`#53 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/53/&gt;`_)

* ``KeyError: 'Nov'``
  (`#50 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/50/&gt;`_)

* ``ValueError: Invalid date.``
  (`#55 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/55/&gt;`_)

* ``LockedException: Unable to take lock on...``
  (`#69 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/69&gt;`_)

* ``OverflowError: long int too large to convert to float``
  (`#75 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/75&gt;`_)

* ``Exception: No timeline set``
  (`#56 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/56&gt;`_)

* ``TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'TimeDelta'``
  (`#48 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/48/&gt;`_, `#78 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/78&gt;`_)

* ``WindowsError: [Error 32] The process cannot access the file because it is
  being used by another process``
  (`#33 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/33/&gt;`_)

Windows specific:

* The log file is created in a standard user temp directory. This ensures that
  even if Timeline is installed in a read-only location, the log file can be
  created.
  (`#74 &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/thetimelineproj/backlog/74&gt;`_)

* Broken fragments of sidebar is not shown at startup.
