Release Actions
===============

Describes the actions to make a source release.

Binary releases are created from source releases. Scripts in our other
repositories (win, and deb) are used for those purposes.

Before
------

  * Check that README, CHANGES, and INSTALL are up to date
  * Import translations from Launchpad
  * Check that authors are correct in AUTHORS and timelinelib/about.py
  * Run unit tests

Under
-----

  * Update version.py so that version number is correct and DEV=False
  * Run python release.py
    * Look out for warning messages at the end 
  * Try running the unzipped release to make a basic check that it works
  * Tag with x.y.x
  * Create a downloadable release on SF

After
-----

  * Close the milestone in Trac
  * Add the new version in Trac 
  * Change version in version.py to next version, DEV=True
  * Write news on SF and Freshmeat
