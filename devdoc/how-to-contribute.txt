How to contribute a change
==========================

When you have cloned a repository and done some local changes it is time to
share those changes. Only the core developers have write access to the
repositories and they can push their changes over ssh using the following
address:

    hg push ssh://USERNAME@thetimelineproj.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/thetimelineproj/REPO

(Core developers can also clone a repository using the ssh address above.)

If you are not a core developer you need to submit your changes as patches to
the developer mailing list <thetimelineproj-developer@lists.sourceforge.net>.
