Code Review
===========

The purpose of code review is to improve the quality of the program and the
skills of the programmers.

How?
----

Our code reviews are informal and done on the project's developer mailing list.
If you feel like reviewing some code, go ahead, and then submit your comments
to the mailing list.

It is **important** that you include the filename together with the revision
number that you reviewed.

One idea would be to always do a code review when a new commit is made. Review
all changes and make sure they are ok. If they do not look right, changes can
be discussed on the mailing list.

Checklists
----------

Here are some points to have in mind when doing a code review:

  * Does the code follow the [coding guidelines](guidelines.txt)?
  * Are variable names meaningful?
  * Is it possible to guess what a method does by just looking at the name and
    comment?
